# System Programming Projects

This repository contains two classic system programming implementations:

1. Dining Philosophers Problem
2. Custom Shell Implementation

## Projects Overview

### 1. Dining Philosophers Problem

A concurrent programming solution to the classic dining philosophers problem, implemented in both C and C++.

#### Key Features:

- Dual implementation (C and C++)
- POSIX threads for concurrency
- Deadlock prevention mechanisms
- Real-time state visualization
- Thread-safe operations

#### Technologies:

- C/C++
- POSIX Threads
- Mutex/Semaphores
- Modern C++ features (in C++ version)

### 2. Custom Shell

_[Note: Please update this section with your Custom Shell project details]_

A custom implementation of a shell interface with basic shell functionalities.

#### Suggested Key Features:

- Command execution
- Process management
- Built-in commands
- Input/Output redirection
- Pipeline support

#### Technologies:

- C/C++
- System calls
- Process management APIs

## Requirements

- Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS)
- GCC/G++ compiler
- POSIX threads support
- C++11 or later (for C++ implementations)

## Building and Running

Each project has its own build instructions. Please refer to their respective directories:

- [Philosopher Project](./Philosopher/)
- [Custom Shell Project](./Custom-Shell/)
